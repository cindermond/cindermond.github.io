    <b>About Me</b>
</p>

<p>
I am Hongyu Zhao (赵鸿宇), a second-year M.S. student at UChicago Computational and Applied Mathematics program. I do my reseach in Toyota Technology Institute at Chicago (TTIC), supervised by <a href="https://www.hongyuanmei.com/">Hongyuan Mei</a>. My other major collaboraters include Mo Yu and Hao Tan.
<br>
Before joining UChicago, I received B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. 
<br>
My research goal is to develop an NLP solution to Explainable AI. Ultimately I want to develop a systematic approach to make any large pretrained model explain its bahaviour in natural language, with human-understandable concepts and reasoning. I believe that to reach this goal, some prior works in parameter-efficient transfer learning, logical inference and few-shot/semi-supervised learning need to be done.

I'm a very good go player. I've been playing this game for more than a decade when DeepMind's AlphaGo gave the community a real shock in 2016. The event not only aroused my interest in AI, but also played a role in shaping my research goal: Human go masters have published so many books talking about their own understanding of the game, sometimes with their self-invented concepts. If a machine can play much better, why can't it develop its own theory and explain it to us?

<p>
I play all kinds of card games, including traditional games like contract bridge and poker, popular TCGs like MTG and YuGiOh, and modern cyber games like DQ and STS. I feel sanity in the unification of these different axiomatic systems, each is simple yet bears so much possibilities.

I enjoyed jogging at late nights when I was in China. I'm now trying to develop some new habits here in America -- I really don't like gyms that much.
