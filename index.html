    <b>About Me</b>
</p>

<p>
I am Hongyu Zhao (赵鸿宇), a second-year M.S. student at UChicago Computational and Applied Mathematics program. I do my reseach in Toyota Technology Institute at Chicago (TTIC), supervised by <a href="https://www.hongyuanmei.com/">Hongyuan Mei</a>. My other major collaboraters include Mo Yu and Hao Tan.
<br>
Before joining UChicago, I received B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. 
<br>
My research goal is to make computers act like human. To reach this goal, I'm generally interested in machine learning topics. Specially, computers need to understand human language and logic, so I'm interested in building models for natural language understanding and logical inference.
You could find my CV <a href="toadd">here</a>.

Here is a <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/Courses/ComputerGraphics_2020_spring-summer/Projects/index2.html">game</a> I made as a 2-week course project when I was an undergraduate. The website is in Chinese but a playthrough video is available.
